## Orange Book üçä

- Mental health is when you wake up every morning with a clear purpose, 
    - you know what you want from life because you had the courage to make choices, 
    - you have intellectually stimulating goals that make your mind grow year after year, 
    - you have learned how to effectively ignore everything that has nothing to do with your life, 
    - and you know how to focus on what will inevitably get you closer to who you want to be and to the life you want to have.

- Life suddenly gets better once you stop daydreaming about how your life is supposed to look like and start paying the price of what it takes to become who you want to be.

- The less you obsess about the destination, the more you will enjoy the ride.

- Keeping the promises you‚Äôve been making to yourself is the antidote to anxiety. 



- Getting and staying fit, athletic, mobile is one of the best things you can do for your mental health.

- If you struggle to do it for yourself, then do it for the people who believe in you.









## Thoughts from internet :

### [Depth-First Procrastination](https://borretti.me/article/depth-first-procrastination)

-   You start with a high-level goal , and rather than taking the optimal route, a combination of intellectual curiosity and anxiety about standing on shaky foundations leads you to spawn subgoal after subgoal after subgoal, until you hit rock bottom and you find yourself doing some task so distantly related to the original goal you‚Äôre in another universe entirely.

-   And it‚Äôs always bullshit. Labouring in obscurity on some grandiose scheme for years is overrated. Tighten the feedback loop: trim the fat, ship, react, iterate. Do or die.
